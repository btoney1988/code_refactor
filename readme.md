# Horiseon Website Design

This is an HTML5 and 508 complient page. The is a business development page explaining how to get the most out of your business through search engine optimization, online reputation management, and social media marketing.  Also showing the importance of lead generation, brand awareness, and cost management. 

I was able to take a lot out of the CSS coding due to updating the HTML to make it more HTML5 complient. All of the images have a alt command to them in order to make them more accessable.
