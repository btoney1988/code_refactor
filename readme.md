# Horiseon Website Design

This is an HTML5 and 508 complient page. The page is a 

## Motivation

My motivation behind this project was to bring this page more accessability ensuring that people with disabilities or socio-economic restrictions have access to the website. In doing so, I notices some other changes that needed to be made in order to make the code easier to read. Below are the individual changes I made to the HTML and CSS files.

## HTML Changes

In the title command I changed it to show the company name, Horiseon, instead of just saying wedsite. 

I decided to make the "seo" in the header command a little darker in order to emphasis the difference more.

In order to make the page more accessable, I added alt commands <img src="./images/search-engine-optimization.jpg" class="float-left" alt="This is an image representing search engine optimization."> to all of the images. 

I also added the img command <div> <img src="./images/digital-marketing-meeting.jpg" class="hero" alt="Image of people working together as a team."></div> in order to make the image more accessable.

In order to get the search-engine-optimization link at the top to work I added the ID command to the code that was originally missing.

## CSS Changes

I noticed that the CSS coding was all over the place and very hard to read. I ended up moving it around in order to make it easier to read and to follow the structure of the HTML file. 

Added comments in the CSS coding in order to make it easier to read.

While testing the website I notices a few of the CSS commands were not doing anything so I removed them to help give it a cleaner look.
